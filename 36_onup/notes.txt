Most errors can be avoided through incremental development.
Only the first error message is reliable, so fix one error then recompile.
Check for syntax errors
If that doesnt work, make a backup, delete half the code from the original file, and recompile.

Run-time Errors

Some programs appear to stop and do nothing, called "hanging"
If a loop is causing the issue, print a message directly before and after the loop.
if second message does not print, it is an infinite loop
Usually, an infinite recursion will cause program to return stackoverflowerror.C
Check for a base case in the method causing infinite recursion
if there is base case, add print statement at beginning that shows parameters
exceptions are normally caused by trying to access int vars or invoking a method on a null object
this may be caused by declaring a variable but not assigning it a value
Sometimes programmers add too many print statements, causing them to get overflowed with outputs
try removing or commenting out print statements that arent helpful or combine them.

Logic Errors

Logic Errors are the hardest to find because compiler and interpreter do not throw errors

try breaking code into components
test independently
the equality operator checks if objects are identical, .equals checks equivalence
break complex expressions into a series of assignments with temporary variables
remember to use println, not print, to display output immediately
step away from computer for a bit
use another pair of eyes to look over your program
talk to your duck
