2022-05-23
time spent: .5 hrs

WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS
Use of fill
The coordinate system of processing (everything has positive x,y coordinate, +x is right, +y is down)
Sine and Cosine functions in use (THEY ARE IN RADIANS YALL)
PI variable
delay
triangle function

WHY YOU CARE
It looks cool!!
The sin and cosine are super useful, and can be used to rotate stuffs

DISCO
weird coordinate system
radians

QCC
why weird coordinate system? Why couldn't it be like netlogo?
